# 3. Simulation Ensembles

!!! danger "Required Repo"
    This tutorial will use the [Bouncing Ball VVUQ Demo](https://lc.llnl.gov/gitlab/weave/weave_demos/-/tree/main/CZ/ball_bounce_vvuq) which will have matching tutorial steps.

Once the uncertainty bounds have been determined for our simulation parameters, we can start creating our workflow for our simulation ensembles using one of the [orchestration tools](/tools.md#workflow-orchestration) in WEAVE.

## How Many Simulations to Run?

You can run as many simulations as you would like but the good computational scientist should always consider the computational expenses of their jobs as they relate to time and storage. For instance, consider running millions of simulations that take 1 minute each or hundreds of simulations that take 1 day each. It would not be feasible to run these jobs in a timely fashion. You also have to consider the convergence of QoIs for post-processing the data. For example, you can choose 1024 simulations so you can break the convergence of QoIs into recursive steps: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, and 1024.

## Workflow

The worklow files for the different orchestration tools can be seen below. Notice that Merlin is very similar to Maestro as it extends Maestro. Feel free to run these spec files with the bash commands provided for each orchestration tool in the following sections, but beware that this step in the tutorial is **ONLY** showing how to run simulation ensembles and nothing more.

### Maestro & Merlin

Both the Maestro and Merlin YAML specs have several blocks in their spec files that can be read about in more detail in their respective documentation. In this example, for both Maestro and Merlin, we'll need three of these blocks: `description`, `env`, and `study`.

The `description` block is required by all Maestro and Merlin studies and gives a high level overview of what the study is about. The only two fields in this block are `name` and `description`, which are both required.

The `env` block defines variables that can be used throughout the spec file. In this step we'll add two variables to the `env` block: `OUTPUT_PATH` and `SIM_SCRIPT_PATH`. The `OUTPUT_PATH` variable is a reserved variable in Maestro and Merlin representing the directory path that the study output will be written to. The `SIM_SCRIPT_PATH` variable is a path to our simulation script `ball_bounce.py` that will run our family of simulations. You'll also notice a reference to another reserved variable called `SPECROOT` which gives the root path of the spec file. This is very useful when trying to adjust the paths for loading and saving files since each `study` has its own path. The other variables that will be used in this step of the tutorial are loaded in from the PGEN script.

The `study` block contains each step in the study. The required fields for this block are `name`, `description`, and `run`. Within the `run` section it's required to have a `cmd` field. We only have one step here `run-ball-bounce` which runs the simulation ensemble. We will be adding more steps in the later sections.

From here, the specs start to differ slightly. If you're using Maestro read the [Maestro Specification](./3_simulation_ensembles.md#maestro-specification) section and if you're using Merlin see the [Merlin Specification](./3_simulation_ensembles.md#merlin-specification) section.

#### Maestro Specification

As was stated above, this example is **ONLY** showing how to run simulation ensembles and nothing more using Maestro. In the bash command below, we call our Maestro Spec after the run argument and the PGEN script we created in the previous section using the `--pgen` option. The data that's generated will be located in `03_simulation_ensembles/data`.

Bash Command:

``` bash
maestro run 03_simulation_ensembles/ball_bounce_suite_maestro_simulation_ensembles.yaml --pgen 02_uncertainty_bounds/pgen_ensembles.py
```

Meastro Spec:

``` yaml title="03_simulation_ensembles/ball_bounce_suite_maestro_simulation_ensembles.yaml"
description:
    name: ball-bounce 
    description: A workflow that simulates a ball bouncing in a box over several input sets.

env:
    variables:
        OUTPUT_PATH: ./03_simulation_ensembles/data
        SIM_SCRIPT_PATH: ../ball_bounce.py

study:
    - name: run-ball-bounce
      description: Run a family of simulations of a ball in a box. 
      run:
          cmd: |
            python $(SPECROOT)/$(SIM_SCRIPT_PATH) output.dsv $(X_POS_INITIAL) $(Y_POS_INITIAL) $(Z_POS_INITIAL) $(X_VEL_INITIAL) $(Y_VEL_INITIAL) $(Z_VEL_INITIAL) $(GRAVITY) $(BOX_SIDE_LENGTH) $(GROUP_ID) $(RUN_ID)
```

#### Merlin Specification

!!! note

    For this step in the tutorial, with Merlin you can run either the Maestro spec defined in the section above or the Merlin spec defined below. Either will work but the Merlin-specific spec has certain additions to improve run times. 
    
As was stated above, this example is ONLY showing how to run simulation ensembles via Merlin and nothing more. 

##### Creating the Merlin Spec

As you may have already noticed, Maestro and Merlin have a lot of commonality in their spec files (e.g. the `description`, `env`, and `study` blocks). In this section, we'll go over some additions to the Merlin file that separate it from Maestro: the `user` block and the `merlin` block. 

The `user` block provides a location to define [YAML anchors](https://www.educative.io/blog/advanced-yaml-syntax-cheatsheet#anchors) that allow other variables in the workflow file to be propogated through to the workflow. In this example we create a YAML anchor called `run_ball_bounce` that contains a command to run a family of simulations of a ball bouncing and the maximum number of times we should retry this command if it fails. We'll use this YAML anchor in the study section to help us define our `run-ball-bounce` step.

The `merlin` block is where you can define sample generation and delegate resources for different workers (we won't be needing the samples section for this demonstration so it's been omitted). In this example we specify that we want to create a worker called `ball_bounce_worker` that works on the step called `run-ball-bounce` that we defined in the `study` block. Additionally, we provide the worker with some arguments: `-l INFO`, `--concurrency 4`, `--prefetch-multiplier 2`, and `-O fair` (all argument options can be found [here](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/cli.html)). The `-l INFO` argument sets the log level of the workers to be INFO, `--concurrency 4` tells Merlin to spawn 4 child processes via [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/) to help process the simulations more efficiently, `--prefetch-multiplier 2` tells Celery to grab 2 tasks at a time for each worker, and `-O fair` sets the optimization level to be fair.

Merlin Spec:

``` yaml title="03_simulation_ensembles/ball_bounce_suite_merlin_simulation_ensembles.yaml"
description:
    name: ball-bounce 
    description: A workflow that simulates a ball bouncing in a box over several input sets.

env:
    variables:
        OUTPUT_PATH: ./03_simulation_ensembles/data
        SIM_SCRIPT_PATH: ../ball_bounce.py

user:
    study:
        run:
            run_ball_bounce: &run_ball_bounce
                cmd: |
                  python $(SPECROOT)/$(SIM_SCRIPT_PATH) output.dsv $(X_POS_INITIAL) $(Y_POS_INITIAL) $(Z_POS_INITIAL) $(X_VEL_INITIAL) $(Y_VEL_INITIAL) $(Z_VEL_INITIAL) $(GRAVITY) $(BOX_SIDE_LENGTH) $(GROUP_ID) $(RUN_ID)
                max_retries: 1

study:
    - name: run-ball-bounce
      description: Run a family of simulations of a ball in a box. 
      run:
          <<: *run_ball_bounce

merlin:
    resources:
        task_server: celery
        overlap: False
        workers:
            ball_bounce_worker:
                args: -l INFO --concurrency 4 --prefetch-multiplier 2 -O fair
                steps: [run-ball-bounce]

```

##### Running the Merlin Spec

!!! important
    To be able to use Merlin in a distributed environment (not locally), you first need to make sure you've set up your merlin config file (`app.yaml`). See [Merlin's confluence page](https://lc.llnl.gov/confluence/display/MERLIN) and the [Merlin configuration docs](https://merlin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/merlin_config.html) for more information.

Unlike Maestro, Merlin provides the ability to customize workers individually. This allows for increases in performance by specializing workers for certain tasks. However, this also results in a slightly more complicated study-launching process than Maestro. Let's take a look at Merlin's workflow diagram to see what we mean:

![Merlin Workflow Architecture](../../../assets/images/merlin_arch.png)

From here, we can see that Merlin relies on the user to send a workflow to the server which creates tasks. It also relies on workers to complete those tasks. This may seem like only two steps, creating the tasks and completing them, but we also need to consider what happens to the workers once all the tasks are done being processed. In short, they'll stay up and running, listening for more tasks to complete until we tell them it's ok to stop. Therefore, running a Merlin study can be broken down into three distinct steps:

1. Launching the tasks
2. Launching the workers
3. Stopping the workers

To launch the tasks, we'll use the `merlin run` bash command. This will stage our tasks on the central server and put them in a queue for workers to process. For this example, we call our Merlin Spec after the run argument and provide it the PGEN script we created in [step 2](./2_uncertainty_bounds.md) using the `--pgen` option.

Launching the tasks:

``` bash
merlin run 03_simulation_ensembles/ball_bounce_suite_merlin_simulation_ensembles.yaml --pgen 02_uncertainty_bounds/pgen_ensembles.py
```

To launch the workers, we'll use the `merlin run-workers` bash command. This will launch the workers who will pull work from the task queue that we just created and complete the tasks. In order to specify how to set up the workers we need to provide the `run-workers` command with the Merlin Spec it should be launching workers for.

Launching the workers:

``` bash
merlin run-workers 03_simulation_ensembles/ball_bounce_suite_merlin_simulation_ensembles.yaml
```

Once the `run-ball-bounce` step has completed the data will be located in `03_simulation_ensembles/data`. We can now stop the workers so that they don't continue listening for tasks using the `merlin stop-workers` bash command.

Stopping the workers:

``` bash
merlin stop-workers
```
